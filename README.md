 Create a Concentration Game to use a main menu. The menu
should allow the user to select a level of difficulty and/or quit
the game (a sample menu is shown below). The level of difficulty
could be determined by how many separate numbers the user
has to concentrate on and/or how many seconds the player has
to concentrate. Each time the user completes a single game of
Concentration, the menu should reappear allowing the user to
continue at the same level, at a new level, or simply quit the
game.
